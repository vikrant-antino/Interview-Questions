1. ### What is React?

    React is an **open-source frontend JavaScript library** which is used for building user interfaces especially for single page applications.

2. ### What are the major features of React?

    The major features of React are:

    * It uses **VirtualDOM** instead RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
    * Supports **server-side rendering**.
    * Follows *Unidirectional** data flow or data binding.
    * Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view.

3. ### What is JSX?

    *JSX* is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript (the acronym stands for *JavaScript XML*). Basically it just provides syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement()` function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.

4. ### What is the difference between Element and Component?

    An *Element* is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. *Elements* can contain other *Elements* in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated.


    Whereas a **component** can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a `render()` method. Alternatively, in simple cases, it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns an JSX tree as the output:


5. ### How to create components in React?

    There are two possible ways to create a component.

    1. **Function Components:** This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as first parameter and return React elements:

        ```jsx harmony
        function Greeting({ message }) {
          return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}</h1> 
        }
        ```

    2. **Class Components:** You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as:

        ```jsx harmony
        class Greeting extends React.Component {
          render() {
            return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}</h1>
          }
        }
        ```

6. ### When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?

    If the component needs *state or lifecycle methods* then use class component otherwise use function component.

7. ### What are Pure Components?

    *`React.PureComponent`* is exactly the same as *`React.Component`* except that it handles the `shouldComponentUpdate()` method for you. When props or state changes, *PureComponent* will do a shallow comparison on both props and state. *Component* on the other hand won't compare current props and state to next out of the box. Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever `shouldComponentUpdate` is called.
    
8. ### What is state in React?

    *State* of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components. Let's create an user component with message state,
    
9. ### What are props in React?

    *Props* are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.

    The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:

    1. Pass custom data to your component.
    2. Trigger state changes.
    3. Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component's `render()` method.
    
10. ### What is the difference between state and props?

    Both *props* and *state* are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function.

11. ### What are hooks?
     Hooks is a special function (introduced as a new feature in React 16.8) that lets you use state and other React features without writing a class.

     Let's see an example of useState hook:
     ```jsx
     import { useState } from 'react';

     function Example() {
       // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
       const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

       return (
         <div>
           <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
           <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
             Click me
           </button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```
     **Note:** Hooks can be used inside an existing function component.

1. ### What are synthetic events in React?

    ```SyntheticEvent` is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. It's API is same as the browser's native event, including `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`, except the events work identically across all browsers.
    
2. ### What are "key" props and what is the benefit of using them in arrays of elements?

    A `key` is a special string attribute you **should** include when creating arrays of elements. *Keys* help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.


3. ### What are forward refs?

    *Ref forwarding* is a feature that lets some components take a *ref* they receive, and pass it further down to a child.
    
4. ### What is Virtual DOM?

    The *Virtual DOM* (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of *Real DOM*. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM. It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called *reconciliation*.
    
5. ### What are controlled components?

    A component that controls the input elements within the forms on subsequent user input is called **Controlled Component**, i.e, every state mutation will have an associated handler function.
    
6. ### What are the different phases of component lifecycle?

    There are four different phases of component lifecycle.

    1. **Initialization:** In this phase component prepares setting up the initial state and default props.

    2. **Mounting:** The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers `componentWillMount()` and `componentDidMount()` lifecycle methods.

    3. **Updating:** In this phase, the component get updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state. This phase covers `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `componentWillUpdate()` and `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle methods.

    4. **Unmounting:** In this last phase, the component is not needed and get unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method.

7. ### What is context?

    *Context* provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. For example, authenticated user, locale preference, UI theme need to be accessed in the application by many components.
    
8. ### What is reconciliation?

    When a component's props or state change, React decides whether an actual DOM update is necessary by comparing the newly returned element with the previously rendered one. When they are not equal, React will update the DOM. This process is called *reconciliation*.

1. ### What are error boundaries in React v16?

    *Error boundaries* are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.
    
2. ### How do you memoize a component?

    There are memoize libraries available which can be used on function components. For example `moize` library can memoize the component in another component.

    ```jsx harmony
    import moize from 'moize'
    import Component from './components/Component' // this module exports a non-memoized component

    const MemoizedFoo = moize.react(Component)

    const Consumer = () => {
      <div>
        {'I will memoize the following entry:'}
        <MemoizedFoo/>
      </div>
    }
    ```
 3.  ### What is strict mode in React?

    `React.StrictMode` is an useful component for highlighting potential problems in an application. Just like `<Fragment>`, `<StrictMode>` does not render any extra DOM elements. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants. These checks apply for *development mode* only.

4. ### What are render props?

     **Render Props** is a simple technique for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function. The below component uses render prop which returns a React element.

5. ### What is code-splitting?
     Code-Splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like Webpack and Browserify which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime. The react project supports code splitting via dynamic import() feature. 
     
6. ### What is the benefit of strict mode?
     The <StrictMode> will be  helpful in the below cases

     1. Identifying components with **unsafe lifecycle methods**.
     2. Warning about **legacy string ref** API usage.
     3. Detecting unexpected **side effects**.
     4. Detecting **legacy context** API.
     5. Warning about deprecated findDOMNode usage
    
7. ### What are forward refs?

    *Ref forwarding* is a feature that lets some components take a *ref* they receive, and pass it further down to a child.
